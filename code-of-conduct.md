# Kopi.JS Code of Conduct

All attendees at any Kopi.JS event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

*tl;dr: Be excellent with each other*

## The Quick Version

Kopi.JS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave at the discretion of the organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal and non-verbal communications related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Attendees asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If an attendee engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.

We expect attendees to follow these rules at the event.
